## Reflection

Through this project, we honed our skills in Java, JavaScript, and HTML to display a captivating user-friendly interface. While the project was successfully completed, we ran into a few issues like uncertainty of ideas and lack of knowledge of the programs we used.

Overall, this project helped us improve our efficiency on group coding projects and improved our programming skills.
